NO PROXY


CHANGE ONLY FIRST LINE:
    "NO PROXY" MEANS API SCRIPT WON'T USE PROXIES
    "PROXY" MEANS API WILL TAKE IP:PORT PROXIES FROM PROXIES.TXT
    "AUTH" MEANS API WILL TAKE IP:PORT#USER:PASSWORD PROXIES FROM PROXIES.TXT

DON'T CHANGE ANY OTHER LINE, IF YOU MESS IT UP IT WON'T USE PROXIES
